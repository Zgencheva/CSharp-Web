1. Calculator name is not relevant for string manipulations.
As I can not think of any other common name, I`ll split it in two - Calculator and StringManipulator
2. Use array reducer function to sum the numbers;
3. Math.max insted of for;
4. Use array.map, array.filter, array.reduce when appropriate.
5. == is enough,because we don`t need to check the type.
